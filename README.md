## Performance Analysis

Average execution times for different matrix sizes or number of cars (Y)

Y = 10     | 0.7211	seconds
Y = 100    | 0.7558 seconds
Y = 1000   | 0.7571 seconds
Y = 10000  | 0.8166 seconds

Execution times get noticably slower as the Y input gets higher, as this means the assembly code has to execute its instructions on significantly more values, thus taking more time for it to fully complete. While there is an increase, theres barely any difference in execution times
